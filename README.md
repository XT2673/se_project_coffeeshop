## Plan on improving the project

Personally, I'm not a fan of images with backgrounds in them (ie the cafe picture). I'd like to see the cafe with a more transparent background, so the header looks better on smaller screens. The blocky look makes it look ugly on mobile/tablet. I'm a sucker for .png files, what can I say? It's the graphic artist in me, I guess.

I do enjoy the animation put into this project. I would probably want a cup of coffee/tea on the recipe section with animated steam rising from it. Would certainly add more character to it.

I also like the footer section with the links and how they transition from white to a gray. HOWEVER, I do not like that the logos don't do the same. I'd want them to transition as well. Maybe grow a bit bigger as you hover over the link? Would love it if they changed color as well.

All in all, I very much enjoyed working on this project and the final result came out well! I'm looking forward to seeing what other projects I can get my creative little hands on...
